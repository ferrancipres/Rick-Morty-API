## Overview ##
This project is a **web applitacion** that utilizies an **API to display information** about characters, episodes and locations for  the famous television series **Rick and Morty**. This web application is build using structure of HTML, CSS for the styling, Typescript for the logic. 

The main objective was create a **entertaining and informative website to explore more all the information about Rick & Morty** series and put on practice all we have learned on the last two month in Assembler Institute of Techonology.

## Objective ##
* Obtain information from third-party API’s
* Improve your knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript
* Introduce typescript in your code.
* Learn more about how to integrate APIS and its interaction with the client
* Improve your skills in obtaining asynchronous information by using AJAX
* Structure a WEB project in a clear and orderly manner

## Konwledge Implementation ##
* **HTML:** Implementation of new structure of Bootstrap, new tags, organization.
* **CSS:** Implementation of CSS from own design and also elementos from BootStrap website and be able to customize elements
* **TS:** Becoming familiar with all concepts of typing information

## Features ##
Information that you should obtain from the API of each section:

**Episodes Guide:** In this section you will explore a list of episodes, proving details like: 
* Name
* Air date
* Episode code

**Characters:**
In this section you will explore a list of characters. Each character display a card information  proving details like: 
* Name
* Status
* Species
* Gender 
* Image

**Locations:**
FInally, in this section application provide information about locations featured in the show. 
* Name
* Type
* Dimension

## Installation ## 
Before start de the project, make sure that you have all the implementation installed on your Visual Studio Code. 
Also, you need to include  need to include Bootstrap’s compiled CSS or JS, you can use jsDelivr.  Here attached the code to install Bootstrap via CDN in your CSS style sheet:

```
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-4bw+/aepP/YC94hEpVNVgiZdgIC5+VKNBQNGCHeKRQN+PtmoHDEXuppvnDJzQIu9" crossorigin="anonymous">

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-HwwvtgBNo3bZJJLYd8oVXjrBZt8cqVSpeBNS5n7C8IVInixGAoxmnlMuBnhbgrkm" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
## Challenges ## 
During all the project I had differents challenges (not just a technique level also personal), here attach a list of them: 

- **Vision:** During the project I felt that I haven't the global vision of all the steps to do. In many states of the projects I felt that I didn't know that I had to do or how to start or how to connect diferent sections to print information on the main display. 

- **Practice:** It's a challenge to be able to do a project that includes different concepts like HTML, CSS, TS with only a few weeks of videos, quiz and just ONE pill. Because I understand all the concepts (or almost all), but  I stayed blocked before to start writing code or I have to much respect to made errors or I tried but I am not be able to understand the message of console and it's frustated.

- **Sintaxy error:** During the project I made a lot of sintaxy error, and sometimes I felt sofocated because I was not able to understand where the problem was or why was not working.

- **Work with functions:** As I said on vision, one of the main problems (not in this project in general) was vision to see the road of all the steps. So, this problem create that I wasn't able to structure the code by simple functions and relacionated between them to get a funcionality much bigger. 

In consequence, when I realized about that I had a funcion init with (no more less that 100 lines of code), so I started again the project trying separate all to do in 	a simple functions.

- **Request API with Typescript (and structure async):** Use the structure of API (fetch) with Tyscript and async was a really challenge, because it was difficult with fetch structure simple but all together was almost impossible. I have had to see the CODE LIVE 100 times to understand somethig, but I understand that was necesary to have good practice to make a request on 	API. 

## Conclusion ##
As I said tough project but necessary to implement all the concepts of HTML, CSS, JS & TS that we have learned on Assembler. I feel satisfied because I accomplish all the requirement (include extra requirements) the best way that I know and I hope that you like it.
